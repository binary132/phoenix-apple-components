#  Phoenix Apple Components

---

This is an Xcode-native project stack which implements interfaces for
Phoenix components for iOS and macOS.  It supplies static libraries,
Objective-C++ headers, and CMake modules to support conditional
inclusion in Phoenix for Apple builds.

This is the status of support for the following components:
 - [ ] Renderer
 - [ ] Input
 - [ ] Audio

Note that the intended usage of Phoenix in iOS and macOS is as a
Framework; Phoenix will supply a build chain suitable for inclusion in
an ordinary Apple application.
